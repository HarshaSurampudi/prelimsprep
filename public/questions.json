      "question_text": "In the Union Budget 2011-12, a full exemption from the basic customs duty was extended to the bio-based asphalt (bioasphalt). What is the importance of this material ?\n1. Unlike traditional asphalt, bioasphalt is not based on fossil fuels.\n2. Bioasphalt can be made from nonrenewable resources.\n3. Bioasphalt can be made from organic waste materials.\n4. It is eco-friendly to use bioasphalt for surfacting of the roads. \n\nWhich of the statements given above are correct ?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1, 2 and 3 only",
        "b": "1, 3 and 4 only",
        "c": "2 and 4 only",
        "d": "1, 2, 3 and 4"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is \"1, 3, and 4 only\". Bioasphalt is a type of asphalt that is made from non-petroleum-based renewable resources, such as organic waste materials, including cooking oil, sugar, and rice hulls. Statement 1 is correct. Unlike traditional asphalt, bioasphalt is not based on fossil fuels. Statement 2 is incorrect. Bioasphalt is made from renewable resources and not from nonrenewable resources. Statement 3 is correct. Bioasphalt can be made from organic waste materials. Statement 4 is also correct. The use of bioasphalt for surfacing roads is more environmentally friendly than traditional asphalt because it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and is less harmful to the environment. Therefore, the correct answer is \"1, 3, and 4 only\".",

      "question_text": "Vultures which used to be very common in Indian countryside some years ago are rarely seen nowadays. This is attributed to",
      "options": {
        "a": "The destruction of their nesting sites by new invasive species",
        "b": "A drug used by cattle owners for treating their diseased cattle",
        "c": "Scarcity of food available to them",
        "d": "a widespread, persistent and fatal disease among them"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The decline in the population of vultures in the Indian countryside is primarily attributed to the use of a drug called diclofenac by cattle owners to treat their diseased cattle. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to treat inflammation and pain in cattle. However, when vultures consume the carcasses of cattle treated with diclofenac, they suffer from kidney failure and die. This has resulted in a drastic decline in the population of vultures in India, with some species declining by more than 99% in just a few decades. While destruction of their nesting sites and scarcity of food may also contribute to the decline of vultures, the use of diclofenac is the primary reason for their decline in India. The introduction of alternative drugs such as meloxicam, which are safe for vultures, has been suggested as a solution to this problem.",

        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is Option 3: Both 1 and 2. Explanation: Aadhaar is India`s national identity system, which assigns a unique 12-digit identification number to residents based on their biometric and demographic data. It provides an open Application Programming Interface (APIs) that allows developers to integrate Aadhaar authentication services into their applications and electronic devices. 1. It can be integrated into any electronic device: The statement is correct. The open APIs provided by Aadhaar allow developers to integrate Aadhaar authentication services into any electronic device, such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other internet-connected devices. This means that electronic devices can use Aadhaar authentication to verify the identity of users for accessing various services or transactions, such as banking, e-commerce, government services, etc. 2. Online authentication using iris is possible: The statement is also correct. Aadhaar authentication services support multiple biometric authentication factors, including iris recognition, fingerprint recognition, and facial recognition. This allows users to authenticate their identity online using their biometric data, without the need for physical documents or tokens. The iris recognition technology used in Aadhaar is one of the most secure and accurate biometric authentication methods, making Aadhaar authentication highly reliable and secure. In conclusion, both statements are correct. The open APIs provided by Aadhaar allow for easy integration with any electronic device, and the biometric authentication factors, including iris recognition, make online authentication highly secure.",

        "d": "quality of public distribution varies from State to State"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Official poverty lines in India are calculated based on the cost of a basket of goods and services that is deemed necessary for a person to meet their basic needs. The cost of this basket can vary from state to state due to differences in price levels. Therefore, official poverty lines are higher in some states than in others because price levels vary from state to state.",

      "question_text": "With reference to Convertible Bonds, consider the following statements :\n1. As there is an option to exchange the bond for equity, Convertible Bonds pay a lower rate of interest.\n2. The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices. \n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct ?",
      "options": {
        "a": "1 only",
        "b": "2 only",
        "c": "Both 1 and 2",
        "d": "Neither 1 nor 2"
      },
      "correct_answer": "c",
      "explanation": "The correct option is C) Both 1 and 2.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. **Statement 1: As there is an option to exchange the bond for equity, Convertible Bonds pay a lower rate of interest.**\n\n   - Convertible bonds offer the bondholder the option to convert the bonds into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company. This conversion feature is valuable because it provides the potential for capital appreciation if the company's stock price increases. Due to this potential upside, investors are willing to accept lower interest payments compared to regular bonds. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.\n\n2. **Statement 2: The option to convert to equity affords the bondholder a degree of indexation to rising consumer prices.**\n\n   - The conversion option in convertible bonds gives bondholders the potential to benefit from price appreciation in the underlying stock. If consumer prices rise, often the company\u2019s revenues and profits may increase, potentially leading to an increase in stock prices. This means the bondholder can indirectly benefit from economic growth and inflation, much like having an indexation feature. Although not a direct indexation to consumer prices, the equity conversion option provides a mechanism to gain from rising prices. Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.\n\nIn conclusion, both statements 1 and 2 are correct, making option C) Both 1 and 2 the correct answer.",

        "b": "Israel",
        "c": "Iraq",
        "d": "Yemen"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is option 2: Israel. The term \"Two-state solution\" refers to a proposed solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which envisions the establishment of two separate states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. The idea of a two-state solution has been a cornerstone of international efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. The conflict between Israel and Palestine dates back to the late 1800s and early 1900s when Jews began immigrating to Palestine in significant numbers, then under Ottoman rule. Tensions between Jews and Arabs in the region continued to escalate, leading to the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, during which Israel was established as a Jewish state. The Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip were occupied by Israel in 1967, and the conflict has continued ever since. The two-state solution is seen as the most viable solution to the conflict, as it recognizes the right of both Israelis and Palestinians to self-determination and sovereignty. The solution envisions Israel withdrawing from the occupied Palestinian territories, allowing for the establishment of a fully sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel. The borders between the two states would be negotiated and agreed upon, with Jerusalem serving as the shared capital of both states. Numerous peace negotiations and agreements have been attempted to implement the two-state solution, including the Oslo Accords of 1993 and the Road Map for Peace of 2003. However, progress towards the implementation of a two-state solution has been slow, with both sides continuing to hold deeply entrenched positions and ongoing violence perpetuating the conflict. In recent years, the Trump administration`s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel`s capital and move the US embassy there, as well as Israel`s continued settlement building in the West Bank, have further complicated efforts to achieve a two-state solution. In conclusion, the two-state solution is a proposed solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which envisions the establishment of two separate states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security. Despite numerous attempts to negotiate and implement the solution, progress has been slow, with ongoing violence and deep-seated divisions hindering progress towards a resolution.",

      "question_text": "Consider the following statements : \nStatement-I : India s public sector health care system largely focuses on curative care with limited preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care. \nStatement-II : Under Indias decentralized approach to health care delivery, the States are primarily responsible for organizing health services. \n\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?",
      "options": {
        "a": "Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I",
        "b": "Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I",
        "c": "Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect",
        "d": "Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct"
      },
      "correct_answer": "b",
      "explanation": "Option 1 suggests both statements are accurate and that Statement-II explains Statement-I. However, while Statement-II is correct about India`s decentralized health care delivery, it doesn`t provide a direct explanation for Statement-I about the aspect of care in the public sector health system. In Option 2, both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct. Statement-I deals with the type of health care focus, mainly towards curative care, in the public sector, while Statement-II covers the organization of health services which is majorly through a decentralized approach. Nonetheless, Statement-II does not serve as an explanation for Statement-I. Option 3 implies that Statement-II is incorrect and only Statement-I is correct, which isn`t right as the Indian health care is, in fact, decentralized and States primarily organize health services. Option 4 posits that Statement-I is incorrect while Statement-II is correct, which isn`t accurate as the public sector health care system in India is indeed focused largely on curative care. Hence, the correct answer is Option 2. Both statements are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I.",

      "explanation": "The Congo Basin is the largest drainage basin in Africa, enclosing a vast rainforest ecosystem rich in biodiversity. It`s a crucial part of the Earth`s entire ecological system. Option 1, Cameroon, is correct. The Congo Basin covers parts of nine African countries, including a significant part of Cameroon. Option 2, Nigeria, is not part of the Congo Basin. It lies to the west of the Basin and is mostly drained by the Niger River instead. Option 3, South Sudan, lies to the east of the Congo Basin. Its water drainage is mainly into the Nile River system, not the Congo River system. Option 4, Uganda, is also not part of Congo Basin. Uganda is outside the geographical zone of the basin and its water drainage system is largely associated with the Nile River, not the Congo River. In conclusion, the only country on this list that includes parts of the Congo Basin is Cameroon.",

Their strategic coastal locations enabled extensive maritime commerce. Option 3: Centres of iron-and-steel making - This is incorrect. While iron and steel production was common in ancient India, these locations are not specifically associated with iron and steel production. Option 4: Shrines of Jain Tirthankaras - This is incorrect. Although Jainism was widespread in various parts of India, these places are not specifically renowned as Jain shrines nor associated prominently with Jain Tirthankaras.
